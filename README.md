Markov Chain Text Generation
This repository contains the implementation of a Markov Chain model for generating text at the word level. The project was completed during an internship at Prodigy Infotech.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Markov Chain model that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on learned patterns from a given dataset. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence by analyzing the probabilities of word transitions in the input text data.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The input text is cleaned by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating extra spaces.
Model Development:
A word-level Markov Chain model is built using an adjustable order parameter to capture varying levels of context.
The model learns the probabilities of word transitions from the input text data.
Text Generation:
The model generates text by starting with a random state and predicting the next word based on the learned probabilities.
The generated text can be of a specified length, ensuring flexibility in output.
Implementation Details
Markov Chain Model:
The model is implemented using a defaultdict from the collections module to store word transition probabilities.
The order of the Markov Chain can be adjusted to control the amount of context considered for predicting the next word.
Text Generation:
The generation process begins with a random state from the model's learned states.
The next word is chosen based on the probabilities of word transitions from the current state.
This process is repeated until the desired length of text is generated.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Markov Chains in text generation tasks by leveraging word-level transitions. The developed model can be used to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, showcasing the effectiveness of probabilistic models in natural language processing.
